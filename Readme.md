        ---------------------------------------------

                sub-programs - self contianed block of code-
                targeting a specific action/operation.

                func funName(param1 type,param2 type..)  {

                len(slice)              number of eles in that slice
                cap(slice)              number of eles in the array of te slice, starting from the first

                        has a set of method declarations that
                        can be implemented by structures.

                        interfaces provide abstraction and polymorphisim.

                        a map is a key-value pair collection.

        Pointers
        -------------------------------------------------
        
                a pointer is a variable that can
                store the address of another variable.

        defer, panic and recover
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------

                defer is a keyword that postpones the execution of 
                a function call, until the caller function completes.

                panic is a built in function used to abruptly
                end the execution of the current function and raise
                an error....

                recover is a built in function used to receive, and error
                if one exits, when ever recover() is called, we get 'nil'
                if no error occured, ore else it retrive the value passed to
                the panic that occured.

                             sleep method is used to pause our current thread

                Channels

                        a channel is a stream of data 
                        into which one can send 
                        and other can receive 

                        both sender and receiver has to wait,
                        until the opponent is done.

                        <-      channel operator

                        ch := make(chan int)

                        x:= <-ch        //reading from the channel

                signal
                                is any channel that does not produce data,
                                but is used only to inform the compeltion
                                of a goroutine...     

                Synchronization
                -------------------------------------------------------

                        control the acess of multiple threads to shared memory/ data

                        
                Monitor and Lock Machanisim

                        resource is locked as and
                        when a thread starts usign it.

                        the resource will not available for any other thread.

                        a monitor ensures that the resource is unlocked
                        once the current thread accomplishes its job.

                Wait and notify machanisim / Producer-Consumer Pattern

                        a Bucket of water
                                emp1 should fill the bucket using a mug
                                emp2 should empty the bucket using a equal sized mug

                                1) If the bucket is empty:
                                        emp2 should wait until the bucket is refiled\
                                2) If the bucket is full:
                                        emp1 should wait until the bucket is a little emptied
                                3) If the bucket is full some arbitary level
                                        emp1 should fill the bucket using a mug
                                        emp2 should empty the bucket using a equal sized mug
                                
                        the current thread can choose to wait
                        even before the job is done, and 
                        the other waiting threads are notified...!

                        so that the locked resource cna be realeased
                        for the next witing thread,

                        The channels are by default synchroinized
                        and hence the wait / notify is always
                        available no extra cost.

                with out converting them into modules.
